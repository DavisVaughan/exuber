Testing for and dating periods of explosive dynamics (exuberance) in time series 
using the univariate and panel recursive unit root tests proposed by [Phillips et al. (2015)](doi:10.1111/iere.12132) and [Pavlidis et al. (2016)](doi:10.1007/s11146-015-9531-2). 
The recursive least-squares algorithm utilizes the matrix inversion lemma to avoid matrix 
inversion which results in significant speed improvements. Simulation of a variety of 
periodically-collapsing bubble processes.

### Installation

```{r installation, eval = FALSE}
# Install release version from CRAN
install.packages("exuber")

# Install development version from GitHub
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("kvasilopoulos/exuber")
```

If you encounter a clear bug, please file a reproducible example on [GitHub](https://github.com/kvasilopoulos/exuber/issues).

### Usage

Testing explosive time series is based on two principles, estimating t-statistics and generating
critical values..

For the former we use the `radf()` which is able to 

For generating critical values we have several options. Firstly, the package offers in the form of
`data` simulated critical values (up to 700 observations) that are obtain with the `mc_cv()` functions
The user has option

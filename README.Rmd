Testing for and dating periods of explosive dynamics (exuberance) in time series 
using the univariate and panel recursive unit root tests proposed by [Phillips et al. (2015)](doi:10.1111/iere.12132) and [Pavlidis et al. (2016)](doi:10.1007/s11146-015-9531-2). 
The recursive least-squares algorithm utilizes the matrix inversion lemma to avoid matrix 
inversion which results in significant speed improvements. Simulation of a variety of 
periodically-collapsing bubble processes.

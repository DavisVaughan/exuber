\title{Date-stamping periods of mildly explosive behavior}
\usage{
\method{datestamp}{radf}(object, cv = NULL, option = c("gsadf",
  "sadf"), min_duration = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{min_duration}{The minimum duration of an explosive period for it to be
reported. Default is 0.}
}
\value{
Returns a list of values for each explosive sub-period, giving the origin
and termination dates as well as the number of periods explosive behavior lasts.
}
\description{
Computes the origination, termination and duration of
episodes during which the time series display explosive dynamics.
}
\details{
Datestamp also stores a vector in {0,1} that corresponds to {reject, accept}
respectively, for all series in the time period. This output can be used as
a dummy that indicates the occurrence of a bubble.

Setting \code{min_duration} removes very short episode of exuberance.
Phillips et al. (2015) propose two simple rules of thumb to remove short
periods of explosive dynamics, "log(T)/T", where T is the number of observations.

\title{Diagnostics and date stamping periods of mildly explosive behaviour}
\usage{
diagnostics(object, cv, option = c("gsadf", "sadf"))

datestamp(object, cv, option = c("gsadf", "sadf"), min_duration = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{\link[=radf]{radf()}}.}

\item{cv}{An object of class "cv". The output of \code{\link[=mc_cv]{mc_cv()}},
\code{\link[=wb_cv]{wb_cv()}} or \code{\link[=sb_cv]{sb_cv()}}}

\item{option}{Whether to apply the "gsadf" or "sadf" methodology. Default is
"gsadf".}

\item{min_duration}{The minimum duration of an explosive period for it to be
reported. Default is 0.}
}
\value{
\code{\link[=diagnostics]{diagnostics()}}: Returns a list with the
series that reject and the series that do not reject the Null Hypothesis

\code{\link[=datestamp]{datestamp()}}: Returns a list of values for
each explosive sub-period, giving the origin and termination dates as well
as the number of periods explosive behavior lasts.
}
\description{
Computes the origination, termination and duration of episodes during which
the time series display explosive dynamics.
}
\details{
In \code{\link[=diagnostics]{diagnostics()}} and
\code{\link[=datestamp]{datestamp()}} have also stored a vector in {0,1}
that corresponds to {reject, accept} respectively.

Setting \code{min_duration} allows temporary spikes above the critical value
sequence to be removed. Phillips et al. (2015) propose a simple way to remove
small periods of explosiveness by a rule of thumb such as "log(T)" or
"log(T)/T", where T is the number of observations.

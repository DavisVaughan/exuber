\title{Date-stamping periods of mildly explosive behavior}
\usage{
datestamp(object, cv = NULL, min_duration = 0L, ...)

\method{datestamp}{radf}(
  object,
  cv = NULL,
  min_duration = 0L,
  option = c("gsadf", "sadf"),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{\link[=radf]{radf()}}.}

\item{cv}{An object of class "cv". The output of \code{\link[=mc_cv]{mc_cv()}},
\code{\link[=wb_cv]{wb_cv()}} or \code{\link[=sb_cv]{sb_cv()}}}

\item{min_duration}{The minimum duration of an explosive period for it to be
reported. Default is 0.}

\item{...}{further arguments passed to methods.}

\item{option}{Whether to apply the "gsadf" or "sadf" methodology. Default is "gsadf".}
}
\value{
Returns a list of values for each explosive sub-period, giving the origin
and termination dates as well as the number of periods explosive behavior lasts.
}
\description{
Computes the origination, termination and duration of
episodes during which the time series display explosive dynamics.
}
\details{
Datestamp also stores a vector in {0,1} that corresponds to {positive, negative}
respectively, for all series throughout the time period. This output can be used as
a dummy that indicates the occurrence of a bubble.

Setting \code{min_duration} removes very short episode of exuberance.
Phillips et al. (2015) propose two simple rules of thumb to remove short
periods of explosive dynamics, "log(T)/T", where T is the number of observations.
